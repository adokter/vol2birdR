This is the R-version of vol2bird. The original version of vol2bird can be found here: https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird.

Since the building of R-packages needs special attention, several of the dependencies has been integrated into this project
instead of assuming that they exists on the target OS to simplify the build and installation process.
Most of the dependencies are licensed as LGPL and as such, this project has also been developed under the LGPL license.

Radar Software Library (RSL)  - src/librsl
High Level HDF (HL-HDF)       - src/libhlhdf
RAVE                          - src/librave
