\description{
Installs Mistnet and its dependencies.
}
\details{
When using \code{path} to install in a specific location, make sure the \code{MISTNET_HOME} environment
variable is set to this same path to reuse this installation. The \code{TORCH_INSTALL} environment
variable can be set to \code{0} to prevent auto-installing torch and \code{TORCH_LOAD} set to \code{0}
to avoid loading dependencies automatically. These environment variables are meant for advanced use
cases and troubleshooting only.
When timeout error occurs during library archive download, or length of downloaded files differ from
reported length, an increase of the \code{timeout} value should help.
