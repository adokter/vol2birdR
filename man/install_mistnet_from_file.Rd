\arguments{
\item{version}{The Torch version to install.}

\item{libtorch}{The installation archive file to use for Torch. Shall be a \code{"file://"} URL scheme.}

\description{
Installs Torch and its dependencies from files.
}
\details{
When \code{"install_mistnet()"} initiated download is not possible, but installation archive files are
present on local filesystem, \code{"install_torch_from_file()"} can be used as a workaround to installation issue.
\code{"libtorch"} is the archive containing all torch modules, and \code{"libmistnet"} is the C interface to libtorch
that is used for the R package. Both are highly dependent, and should be checked through \code{"get_install_libs_url()"}
